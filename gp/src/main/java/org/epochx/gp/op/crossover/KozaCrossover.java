/**
 * This class implements a Koza style crossover operation on two
 * <code>CandidatePrograms</code>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Koza crossover performs a one point exchange with the choice of a swap point
 * being either a function or terminal node with assigned probabilities. This
 * class provides a constructor for specifying a probability of selecting a
 * function swap point. The default constructor uses the typical rates of 90%
 * function node swap point and 10% terminal node swap points.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If a model is provided then the following parameters are loaded upon every
 * configure event:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>random number generator</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If the <code>getModel</code> method returns <code>null</code> then no model
 * is set and whatever static parameters have been set as parameters to the
 * constructor or using the standard accessor methods will be used. If any
 * compulsory parameters remain unset when the crossover is performed then an
 * <code>IllegalStateException</code> will be thrown.
 * 
 * @see SubtreeCrossover
 * @see OnePointCrossover
