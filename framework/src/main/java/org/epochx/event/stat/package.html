Provides classes that are related to the <i>Stat System</i>.

<P>Stats are implemented by subclassing the {@link AbstractStat} class. The {@link AbstractStat}
class is not only the base class for stats, but also provides a mechanism to register and
retrieve stat objects. Stats classes are not instantiated directly, instead they are
registered in a repository.</P>
