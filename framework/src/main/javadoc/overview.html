<P>EpochX has been designed with a modular structure, comprised of a core evolutionary
framework and separate packages to support specific representations. The core framework
of EpochX includes the components of the evolutionary algorithm itself and provides an
infrastructure for modifying most aspects of this algorithm.</P>

<P>An evolutionary run is performed by creating an {@link org.epochx.Evolver} object and calling
its {@link org.epochx.Evolver#run()} method:

<PRE>
Evolver evolver = new Evolver();
evolver.run();
</PRE>
</P>

<P>The {@link org.epochx.Evolver} class is composed of a pipeline of components, which are
executed sequentially when the evolver's {@link org.epochx.Evolver#run()} method is called. Each
component is passed a population of individuals as input and after performing some
processing, returns a population of individuals which the pipeline will pass on to the
next component. By default, the evolver's pipeline is composed of three components: 

<PRE>
1. {@link org.epochx.Initialiser}
2. {@link org.epochx.FitnessEvaluator}
3. {@link org.epochx.EvolutionaryStrategy}
</PRE>
</P>

<P>An empty population is passed to the first component, which would typically generate
an initial population. The {@link org.epochx.FitnessEvaluator} component will then use a fitness
function provided by the user to assign a {@link org.epochx.Fitness} to each individual in the
population. Then, this initial population will be passed to the {@link org.epochx.EvolutionaryStrategy},
which is responsible for evolving the population. Different implementations of each of these
components are possible, and the pipeline may be modified to use a different set of components
entirely.</P>
